///
/// Draw closed, looping curves inspired by a pen carried around inside a larger circle. Change the inner
/// radius and pen distance to collect very different patterns.
///
/// **Your mission:** The curve calculation rounds away part of the radius ratio. Repair radiusRatio so
/// integer radii can still give fractional ratios, including a result smaller than one.
///
/// **Today you learn:** Type of an expression: Java evaluates the division before returning it. A double
/// result declaration alone cannot rescue integer division; use an example such as 40 divided by 80 to
/// reason about the intended fraction.
///
/// Use Run File, change the inner radius with Left/Right and the pen distance with Up/Down, then compare
/// the redrawn curves.
/// After your repair: Save → Test File → play again.
double radiusRatio(int outer, int innerRadius) {
    return (outer - innerRadius) / (double) innerRadius;
}

// <editor-fold defaultstate="collapsed" desc="Read this code">
/// ## Read these particular lines
///
/// - `double radiusRatio(int outer, int innerRadius)` — The result can be fractional, although the two
///   received radii are whole numbers.
/// - `outer - innerRadius` — Subtract the smaller radius from the larger one before calculating their
///   ratio.
/// - `(outer - innerRadius)` — Parentheses keep this subtraction together as the numerator.
/// - `/ innerRadius` — The division currently has two whole-number operands; its fractional part can be
///   lost here.
/// - `return` — Give the completed ratio to point, which uses it in the real curve.
///
/// ### What the prepared part already does
///
/// point turns the ratio into pen positions. period and gcd determine when the curve closes; render joins
/// positions into lines, while the later keyboard and saving code provide parameter changes and a PNG
/// export.
// </editor-fold>

// <editor-fold defaultstate="collapsed" desc="Step-by-step hints">
/// ## If you get stuck
///
/// 1. A double return type does not undo earlier integer division.
/// 2. Convert one operand before the division.
/// 3. Use (outer - innerRadius) / (double) innerRadius.

// <editor-fold defaultstate="collapsed" desc="Small Java map · optional">
/// ## An unfamiliar piece of Java?
///
/// This small map is optional. Look up just the symbol or word you need; no need to learn it all first.
///
/// - `///` — Words for the reader. Java skips these comment lines when running.
/// - `import` — Makes library names available in this file; it does not run the library.
/// - `;` — Ends one statement, like a full stop. A semicolon inside a for header separates its three
///   parts.
/// - `()` — After a name: call an action, or list its parameters in its declaration. Empty parentheses
///   mean no supplied arguments.
/// - `{}` — Braces group a block of code. The opening and closing brace belong together.
/// - `.` — Accesses something belonging to the value or type on its left, such as IO.println.
/// - `void` — This method performs an action and returns no result value.
/// - `main` — Java starts the program here. Other method declarations do not run just because they appear
///   earlier in the file.
/// - `int` — A type for whole numbers within a fixed range.
/// - `double` — A type for approximate fractional numbers. Java uses a decimal point.
/// - `boolean` — A value that is either true or false.
/// - `String` — Text, such as "Red Fox". Double quotes mark text literally written in the code.
/// - `"` — Double quotes enclose a text literal. The quotes themselves are not part of its text.
/// - `\` — Inside quoted text, starts an escape such as \n for a new line or \" for a quote.
/// - `final` — The named value cannot be assigned another value afterwards. A referenced mutable object
///   can still change.
/// - `var` — Java infers the local value’s type from the expression on the right. It still has one fixed
///   type.
/// - `=` — Stores the value on the right under the name on the left. It does not compare them.
/// - `==` — Compares primitive values. For text contents, use equals instead.
/// - `!=` — Checks that two values differ.
/// - `&&` — Both conditions must be true; if the first is false, Java skips the second.
/// - `!` — In front of a boolean expression, reverses true and false.
/// - `++` — Increases a numeric value by one.
/// - `%` — The remainder after division; useful for repeated positions or turns.
/// - `+` — Adds numbers. When a String is involved, joins text instead.
/// - `-` — Subtracts numbers; in front of one number, changes its sign.
/// - `*` — Multiplies numbers. In an import such as java.awt.*, makes that package’s type names
///   available.
/// - `/` — Divides numbers. Dividing two int values discards the fractional part.
/// - `<` — Compares numbers: less than. <= also permits equality; > and >= compare in the other
///   direction. In List<String>, angle brackets describe the element type.
/// - `:` — In for (int value : values), reads each element in turn. It also separates the two
///   alternatives of ? : or follows a switch label.
/// - `new` — Creates a fresh value or object, such as a new array or window.
/// - `return` — Ends this method call, optionally handing a result back to its caller.
/// - `if` — Runs its body only when the condition in parentheses is true.
/// - `for` — Repeats a block over a range or a sequence of values.
/// - `while` — Keeps repeating its body while its condition stays true.
/// - `switch` — Selects one case from a set of alternatives. It can also produce a result.
/// - `case` — One alternative of a switch; the arrow points to what it does or returns.
/// - `->` — In switch: a case result or action. In a lambda: describes an action to perform when called
///   later.
/// - `::` — A method reference: supplies an action without calling it yet.
/// - `this` — The current game object: this particular run and its stored state.
/// - `public` — Makes this declaration accessible to other code.
/// - `protected` — A visibility keyword used by supplied library callbacks, such as paintComponent.
/// - `super` — In super.paintComponent(g), asks the supplied parent implementation to paint its standard
///   background first.
/// - `null` — No object is present. IO.readln returns null when the input stream ends.
/// - `try` — A block whose possible failures can be handled by the following catch.
/// - `catch` — Handles the named kind of exception instead of leaving that failure unexplained.
/// - `throws` — In a method declaration: tells callers which failure they may need to handle.
/// - `Graphics2D` — The drawing tool supplied while a window or image is being painted.
/// - `JFrame` — A desktop window supplied by the JDK’s Swing library.
/// - `JPanel` — A window area that can display the game’s drawing or controls.
/// - `@Override` — Marks a supplied replacement for a library action, such as painting.
/// - `SwingUtilities.invokeLater` — Schedules window work for Swing’s event thread; the action runs
///   later.
