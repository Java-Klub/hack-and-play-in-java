/// ### Enum: one of the named choices
///
/// An enum defines a finite set of values of one type. The type name and dot qualify a particular
/// value. Unlike arbitrary text, a misspelled enum value is a compiler error. A variable holds one
/// choice at a time; comparing enum values with `==` is appropriate.
///
/// ```java
/// enum Voice {
///     WHISPER, SING, SHOUT
/// }
///
/// Voice voice = Voice.SING;
/// IO.println(voice == Voice.SHOUT);
/// ```
///
/// The declaration belongs beside methods; the statements can be read inside a method. The comparison
/// prints false because SING and SHOUT are distinct values. Predict it after assigning SHOUT. Can
/// this single variable simultaneously claim SING and SHOUT? Explain what contradictory combinations
/// separate booleans might allow.

// <editor-fold defaultstate="collapsed" desc="Read this code">
/// ## Read these particular lines
///
/// - `enum RoundState` — Names the three possible conditions of one round.
/// - `dotsLeft == 0` — A comparison tests whether the last dot has gone; it does not describe ghost
///   contact.
/// - `return RoundState.WON` — Returns one named state immediately, so later branches will not run.
/// - `if (caught)` — Checks the independent capture fact supplied by step().
///
/// ### What the prepared part already does
///
/// step() moves the player, collects a dot, and checks ghost contact before asking afterContact().
/// moveGhost() already chooses legal neighbours, and drawing uses the returned RoundState.

// <editor-fold defaultstate="collapsed" desc="For this game">
/// ### One event can satisfy two conditions
///
/// Enum values make the final result exclusive, but conditions can still overlap. The stated contract
/// gives capture priority over collecting the last dot. Predict the result for caught with no dots,
/// uncaught with no dots, and uncaught with some dots. These are distinct input situations, not three
/// states to assign in sequence. Explain which earlier return prevents a later condition from
/// replacing the intended result.

/// This small map is optional. Look up just the symbol or word you need; no need to learn it all first.
///
/// - `///` — Words for the reader. Java skips these comment lines when running.
/// - `import` — Makes library names available in this file; it does not run the library.
/// - `;` — Ends one statement, like a full stop. A semicolon inside a for header separates its three
///   parts.
/// - `()` — After a name: call an action, or list its parameters in its declaration. Empty parentheses
///   mean no supplied arguments.
/// - `{}` — Braces group a block of code. The opening and closing brace belong together.
/// - `.` — Accesses something belonging to the value or type on its left, such as IO.println.
/// - `void` — This method performs an action and returns no result value.
/// - `main` — Java starts the program here. Other method declarations do not run just because they appear
///   earlier in the file.
/// - `int` — A type for whole numbers within a fixed range.
/// - `boolean` — A value that is either true or false.
/// - `String` — Text, such as "Red Fox". Double quotes mark text literally written in the code.
/// - `"` — Double quotes enclose a text literal. The quotes themselves are not part of its text.
/// - `'` — Single quotes enclose one character, such as a board marker.
/// - `final` — The named value cannot be assigned another value afterwards. A referenced mutable object
///   can still change.
/// - `var` — Java infers the local value’s type from the expression on the right. It still has one fixed
///   type.
/// - `=` — Stores the value on the right under the name on the left. It does not compare them.
/// - `==` — Compares primitive values. For text contents, use equals instead.
/// - `!=` — Checks that two values differ.
/// - `&&` — Both conditions must be true; if the first is false, Java skips the second.
/// - `||` — At least one condition must be true; if the first is true, Java skips the second.
/// - `!` — In front of a boolean expression, reverses true and false.
/// - `++` — Increases a numeric value by one.
/// - `+=` — Adds to the old value and stores the result back under the same name.
/// - `%` — The remainder after division; useful for repeated positions or turns.
/// - `+` — Adds numbers. When a String is involved, joins text instead.
/// - `-` — Subtracts numbers; in front of one number, changes its sign.
/// - `*` — Multiplies numbers. In an import such as java.awt.*, makes that package’s type names
///   available.
/// - `<` — Compares numbers: less than. <= also permits equality; > and >= compare in the other
///   direction. In List<String>, angle brackets describe the element type.
/// - `?` — In condition ? first : second, chooses the first value when the condition is true, otherwise
///   the second.
/// - `:` — In for (int value : values), reads each element in turn. It also separates the two
///   alternatives of ? : or follows a switch label.
/// - `[]` — An array or an indexed access. Index 0 denotes the first element; length is the element
///   count.
/// - `new` — Creates a fresh value or object, such as a new array or window.
/// - `return` — Ends this method call, optionally handing a result back to its caller.
/// - `if` — Runs its body only when the condition in parentheses is true.
/// - `else` — The alternative when the preceding if condition is false.
/// - `for` — Repeats a block over a range or a sequence of values.
/// - `switch` — Selects one case from a set of alternatives. It can also produce a result.
/// - `case` — One alternative of a switch; the arrow points to what it does or returns.
/// - `->` — In switch: a case result or action. In a lambda: describes an action to perform when called
///   later.
/// - `::` — A method reference: supplies an action without calling it yet.
/// - `this` — The current game object: this particular run and its stored state.
/// - `public` — Makes this declaration accessible to other code.
/// - `protected` — A visibility keyword used by supplied library callbacks, such as paintComponent.
/// - `super` — In super.paintComponent(g), asks the supplied parent implementation to paint its standard
///   background first.
/// - `record` — A small named bundle of values. Its component accessors use the component names with ().
/// - `enum` — A type whose values are a fixed named set, such as READY, PLAYING and FINISHED.
/// - `Random` — Generates pseudorandom choices. A fixed seed reproduces the same sequence.
/// - `JFrame` — A desktop window supplied by the JDK’s Swing library.
/// - `JPanel` — A window area that can display the game’s drawing or controls.
