/// # L04.05 · WordSearch
///
/// Hunt for CAT, DOG and TIGER in a letter grid by selecting the two ends of a word. A selection can run
/// horizontally, vertically or diagonally, so its direction is part of the puzzle.
///
///
/// **Your mission:** Let a player select every target word from either end. CAT and TAC must record the
/// same target CAT, so selecting it backwards after finding it cannot earn a second find. Keep
/// straight-path validation and reject paths that spell no target. First use the game to find exactly
/// where the current direction matters.
///
/// **Today you learn:** Counted traversal can build a new String in a different order without changing
/// the grid or the original selected text.
///
/// Compare 1 1 1 3 with 1 3 1 1 in fresh rounds. They visit the same cells, but the game currently
/// accepts only one direction.
String targetName(String selected) {
    return selected;

/// A counted `for` puts initialization, a continue condition and progress in one header.
/// Initialization happens once. Then Java checks the condition, runs the body if true, performs
/// progress, and checks again.
///
/// These example statements belong inside a called method.
///
/// ```java
/// for (int floor = 2; floor <= 4; floor++) {
///     IO.println(floor);
/// }

///
/// Predict the visited values: `2`, `3`, `4`. There are three passes, even though the last printed
/// number is four. The two semicolons separate the header’s three parts; `floor++` adds one after a
/// pass. The braces group the repeated statements. If the starting value already fails the condition,
/// no pass occurs. Count positions and gaps separately: three positions have two gaps. Write down a
/// tiny trace before changing a bound.
///
/// Now predict the output if floor starts at five.

/// ## An unfamiliar piece of Java?
///
/// This small map is optional. Look up just the symbol or word you need; no need to learn it all first.
///
/// - `///` — Words for the reader. Java skips these comment lines when running.
/// - `;` — Ends one statement, like a full stop. A semicolon inside a for header separates its three
///   parts.
/// - `()` — After a name: call an action, or list its parameters in its declaration. Empty parentheses
///   mean no supplied arguments.
/// - `{}` — Braces group a block of code. The opening and closing brace belong together.
/// - `.` — Accesses something belonging to the value or type on its left, such as IO.println.
/// - `void` — This method performs an action and returns no result value.
/// - `main` — Java starts the program here. Other method declarations do not run just because they appear
///   earlier in the file.
/// - `int` — A type for whole numbers within a fixed range.
/// - `boolean` — A value that is either true or false.
/// - `String` — Text, such as "Red Fox". Double quotes mark text literally written in the code.
/// - `"` — Double quotes enclose a text literal. The quotes themselves are not part of its text.
/// - `\` — Inside quoted text, starts an escape such as \n for a new line or \" for a quote.
/// - `=` — Stores the value on the right under the name on the left. It does not compare them.
/// - `==` — Compares primitive values. For text contents, use equals instead.
/// - `&&` — Both conditions must be true; if the first is false, Java skips the second.
/// - `||` — At least one condition must be true; if the first is true, Java skips the second.
/// - `!` — In front of a boolean expression, reverses true and false.
/// - `++` — Increases a numeric value by one.
/// - `+=` — Adds to the old value and stores the result back under the same name.
/// - `+` — Adds numbers. When a String is involved, joins text instead.
/// - `-` — Subtracts numbers; in front of one number, changes its sign.
/// - `*` — Multiplies numbers. In an import such as java.awt.*, makes that package’s type names
///   available.
/// - `<` — Compares numbers: less than. <= also permits equality; > and >= compare in the other
///   direction. In List<String>, angle brackets describe the element type.
/// - `[]` — An array or an indexed access. Index 0 denotes the first element; length is the element
///   count.
/// - `new` — Creates a fresh value or object, such as a new array or window.
/// - `return` — Ends this method call, optionally handing a result back to its caller.
/// - `if` — Runs its body only when the condition in parentheses is true.
/// - `for` — Repeats a block over a range or a sequence of values.
/// - `while` — Keeps repeating its body while its condition stays true.
/// - `null` — No object is present. IO.readln returns null when the input stream ends.
/// - `try` — A block whose possible failures can be handled by the following catch.
/// - `catch` — Handles the named kind of exception instead of leaving that failure unexplained.
/// - `throw` — Reports a failure by creating or passing an exception.
/// - `Set` — Stores distinct values; the same value is present at most once.
/// - `IO` — Console input and output. println writes a line. readln waits for a whole line of input.
