/// # 08.26 · BinaryBalance
///
/// Fill a small board with balanced black and white cells without making a run of three. The orange clues
/// should stay fixed while your answers stay editable.
///
/// **Your mission:** A free cell locks after you edit it because answers also change the clue template.
/// Repair copyBoard() to separate both levels of the grid.
///
/// **Today you learn:** Copies and aliasing: an int[][] stores references to row arrays. Copying only the
/// outer array leaves mutable rows shared, so an independent board needs independent rows.
///
/// Run the program and click a non-orange cell repeatedly to switch between unknown, black, and
/// white while following the balance rules.
int[][] copyBoard(int[][] original) {
    return original.clone();
}

// <editor-fold defaultstate="collapsed" desc="Recall · F20">
/// ### A second name is not a saved past
///
/// An array variable holds a reference to an array. Assignment copies that reference, so two names can
/// still reach the same mutable cells.
///
/// ```java
/// int[] live = {1, 2};
/// int[] shared = live;
/// int[] saved = live.clone();
/// live[0] = 7;
/// IO.println(shared[0] + " / " + saved[0]);
/// ```
///
/// This prints `7 / 1`: shared follows the change; saved owns a separate array. `clone()` copies one
/// array's cells. For `int[][]`, those cells contain references to rows. Cloning only the outside
/// therefore still shares rows; copy the rows as well when their contents must survive later edits.
///
/// ```text
/// shared ──→ [7,2] ←── live
/// saved  ──→ [1,2]
/// ```
///
/// Undo needs the old state, so take its snapshot before the live edit. Copying after the edit
/// faithfully saves the wrong moment. Predict what happens if the last assignment is instead `saved[0]
/// = 9`. Which of the three names sees 9? For a list of immutable records, copying membership is
/// enough: the records themselves cannot have their components reassigned.

// <editor-fold defaultstate="collapsed" desc="Read this code">
/// ## Read these particular lines
///
/// - `int[][]` — An outer array contains row references; each row contains the cell values.
/// - `original` — The supplied clue grid is input to copyBoard(), not a board to edit in place.
/// - `.clone()` — Clones one array level; it does not recursively copy arrays referred to by that array.
///
/// ### What the prepared part already does
///
/// restart() builds cells from givens through copyBoard(). cycle() protects any position whose given is
/// nonzero, while lineValid() and won() check balance and repeated runs; those checks are already
/// supplied.
// </editor-fold>

// <editor-fold defaultstate="expanded" desc="For this game">
/// ### Copying rows as well as the outside
///
/// A grid's outer array stores row references. An outer clone therefore copies references to the same
/// rows. Here is a separate two-row example with independent rows:
///
/// ```java
/// int[][] original = {{1}, {2}};
/// int[][] copied = {original[0].clone(), original[1].clone()};
/// copied[0][0] = 9;
/// IO.println(original[0][0]);
/// ```
///
/// The output stays one because the changed row belongs to copied. Predict the result if its first
/// row were merely `original[0]`. Your board has more rows: use the actual row count to repeat the
/// copying operation. Each row's clone preserves its current elements. Explain which layer would
/// remain shared if only the outside were copied.

/// - `;` — Ends one statement, like a full stop. A semicolon inside a for header separates its three
///   parts.
/// - `()` — After a name: call an action, or list its parameters in its declaration. Empty parentheses
///   mean no supplied arguments.
/// - `{}` — Braces group a block of code. The opening and closing brace belong together.
/// - `.` — Accesses something belonging to the value or type on its left, such as IO.println.
/// - `void` — This method performs an action and returns no result value.
/// - `main` — Java starts the program here. Other method declarations do not run just because they appear
///   earlier in the file.
/// - `int` — A type for whole numbers within a fixed range.
/// - `boolean` — A value that is either true or false.
/// - `"` — Double quotes enclose a text literal. The quotes themselves are not part of its text.
/// - `\` — Inside quoted text, starts an escape such as \n for a new line or \" for a quote.
/// - `final` — The named value cannot be assigned another value afterwards. A referenced mutable object
///   can still change.
/// - `var` — Java infers the local value’s type from the expression on the right. It still has one fixed
///   type.
/// - `=` — Stores the value on the right under the name on the left. It does not compare them.
/// - `==` — Compares primitive values. For text contents, use equals instead.
/// - `!=` — Checks that two values differ.
/// - `&&` — Both conditions must be true; if the first is false, Java skips the second.
/// - `||` — At least one condition must be true; if the first is true, Java skips the second.
/// - `!` — In front of a boolean expression, reverses true and false.
/// - `++` — Increases a numeric value by one.
/// - `%` — The remainder after division; useful for repeated positions or turns.
/// - `+` — Adds numbers. When a String is involved, joins text instead.
/// - `-` — Subtracts numbers; in front of one number, changes its sign.
/// - `*` — Multiplies numbers. In an import such as java.awt.*, makes that package’s type names
///   available.
/// - `/` — Divides numbers. Dividing two int values discards the fractional part.
/// - `<` — Compares numbers: less than. <= also permits equality; > and >= compare in the other

/// - `?` — In condition ? first : second, chooses the first value when the condition is true, otherwise
///   the second.
/// - `:` — In for (int value : values), reads each element in turn. It also separates the two
///   alternatives of ? : or follows a switch label.
/// - `[]` — An array or an indexed access. Index 0 denotes the first element; length is the element
