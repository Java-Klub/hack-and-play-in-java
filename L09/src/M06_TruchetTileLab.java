/// # L09.06 · TruchetTileLab
///
/// Arrange curved tiles into a winding pattern where small local choices create long loops. Keep a
/// truthful score of the two tile orientations as the picture grows.
///
/// **Your mission:** The orientation caption reports one for a tile kind however often it occurs. Repair
/// the accumulated counts while preserving the generated pattern.
///
/// **Today you learn:** A Map can keep a separate tally for each named category. Updating one orientation
/// must retain its previous count and leave the other category untouched.
///
/// Use Run File to save truchet-tile-lab.png, then open it and compare its winding tiles with the LEFT
/// and RIGHT counts at the top.
/// After your repair: Save → Test File → play again.

    orientationCounts.put(orientation, 1);

/// ## Read these particular lines
///
/// - `String orientation` — The category name is the key, not a screen coordinate.
/// - `orientationCounts.put` — Writes the value for one orientation and replaces its previous value.
/// - `orientation, 1` — A fixed one loses all earlier occurrences of that category.
///
/// ### What the prepared part already does
///
/// render chooses tile orientations, calls the tally and draws the supplied quarter-circle arcs. The
/// final image caption reads the same map; seed handling and PNG output are prepared.
// </editor-fold>

// <editor-fold defaultstate="collapsed" desc="Step-by-step hints">
/// ## If you get stuck
///
/// 1. LEFT and RIGHT are separate keys.
/// 2. A missing key means zero previous tiles.
/// 3. Store previous count plus one, not a constant one.

/// ## An unfamiliar piece of Java?
///
/// This small map is optional. Look up just the symbol or word you need; no need to learn it all first.
///
/// - `///` — Words for the reader. Java skips these comment lines when running.
/// - `import` — Makes library names available in this file; it does not run the library.
/// - `;` — Ends one statement, like a full stop. A semicolon inside a for header separates its three
///   parts.
/// - `()` — After a name: call an action, or list its parameters in its declaration. Empty parentheses
///   mean no supplied arguments.
/// - `{}` — Braces group a block of code. The opening and closing brace belong together.
/// - `.` — Accesses something belonging to the value or type on its left, such as IO.println.
/// - `void` — This method performs an action and returns no result value.
/// - `main` — Java starts the program here. Other method declarations do not run just because they appear
///   earlier in the file.
/// - `int` — A type for whole numbers within a fixed range.
/// - `double` — A type for approximate fractional numbers. Java uses a decimal point.
/// - `String` — Text, such as "Red Fox". Double quotes mark text literally written in the code.
/// - `"` — Double quotes enclose a text literal. The quotes themselves are not part of its text.
/// - `long` — A type for whole numbers with a larger range than int. A trailing L marks a long literal.
/// - `var` — Java infers the local value’s type from the expression on the right. It still has one fixed
///   type.
/// - `=` — Stores the value on the right under the name on the left. It does not compare them.
/// - `&&` — Both conditions must be true; if the first is false, Java skips the second.
/// - `||` — At least one condition must be true; if the first is true, Java skips the second.
/// - `!` — In front of a boolean expression, reverses true and false.
/// - `++` — Increases a numeric value by one.
/// - `+` — Adds numbers. When a String is involved, joins text instead.
/// - `-` — Subtracts numbers; in front of one number, changes its sign.
/// - `*` — Multiplies numbers. In an import such as java.awt.*, makes that package’s type names
///   available.
/// - `/` — Divides numbers. Dividing two int values discards the fractional part.
/// - `<` — Compares numbers: less than. <= also permits equality; > and >= compare in the other
///   direction. In List<String>, angle brackets describe the element type.
/// - `?` — In condition ? first : second, chooses the first value when the condition is true, otherwise
///   the second.
/// - `:` — In for (int value : values), reads each element in turn. It also separates the two
///   alternatives of ? : or follows a switch label.
/// - `[]` — An array or an indexed access. Index 0 denotes the first element; length is the element
///   count.
/// - `new` — Creates a fresh value or object, such as a new array or window.
/// - `return` — Ends this method call, optionally handing a result back to its caller.
/// - `if` — Runs its body only when the condition in parentheses is true.
/// - `else` — The alternative when the preceding if condition is false.
/// - `for` — Repeats a block over a range or a sequence of values.
/// - `try` — A block whose possible failures can be handled by the following catch.
/// - `catch` — Handles the named kind of exception instead of leaving that failure unexplained.
/// - `throw` — Reports a failure by creating or passing an exception.
/// - `throws` — In a method declaration: tells callers which failure they may need to handle.
/// - `Map` — Associates keys with values. A missing key needs an explicit fallback or decision.
/// - `Random` — Generates pseudorandom choices. A fixed seed reproduces the same sequence.
/// - `IO` — Console input and output. println writes a line; readln waits for one line of text.
/// - `Path` — A file-system location, not the file’s contents.
/// - `Files` — JDK operations for reading and writing local files.
